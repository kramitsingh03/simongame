# About Simon Game
-----------------------------
Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison
Game Setup: Simon consists of a round plastic unit with four colored buttons (usually red, green, blue, and yellow) arranged in a circular pattern. The unit also has a speaker for sound output.

Objective: The objective of the game is to repeat an ever-increasing pattern of colors and sounds that the game generates. The game starts with a simple sequence of one color and sound.

Gameplay: The game begins with a single color/button lighting up and emitting a corresponding sound. The player must then press the button that matches the lit color.

Memory Challenge: After successfully replicating the sequence, Simon adds another color and sound to the pattern. The player must then repeat the entire sequence, including the new addition. This process continues, with the sequence growing longer and more complex as the game progresses.

Scoring: Players earn points based on how long they can remember and replicate the growing sequence correctly. The game often keeps track of high scores or levels reached.

Game Over: The game ends when a player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or failing to replicate the sequence correctly. At this point, the player's score is displayed, and they can choose to play again and try to beat their previous score.

Simon is a fun and challenging game that tests both memory and reflexes. It can be played solo or in a competitive mode with multiple players taking turns to see who can remember and replicate the longest sequence correctly. It has remained a popular choice for both children and adults as a brain-teasing and entertaining pastime.
