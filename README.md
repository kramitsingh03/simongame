# About Simon Game
-----------------------------
Simon is an electronic game of short-term memory skill invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison
Game Setup: Simon consists of a round plastic unit with four colored buttons (usually red, green, blue, and yellow) arranged in a circular pattern. The unit also has a speaker for sound output.

Objective: The objective of the game is to repeat an ever-increasing pattern of colors and sounds that the game generates. The game starts with a simple sequence of one color and sound.

Gameplay: The game begins with a single color/button lighting up and emitting a corresponding sound. The player must then press the button that matches the lit color.

Memory Challenge: After successfully replicating the sequence, Simon adds another color and sound to the pattern. The player must then repeat the entire sequence, including the new addition. This process continues, with the sequence growing longer and more complex as the game progresses.

Scoring: Players earn points based on how long they can remember and replicate the growing sequence correctly. The game often keeps track of high scores or levels reached.

Game Over: The game ends when a player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or failing to replicate the sequence correctly. At this point, the player's score is displayed, and they can choose to play again and try to beat their previous score.

Simon is a fun and challenging game that tests both memory and reflexes. It can be played solo or in a competitive mode with multiple players taking turns to see who can remember and replicate the longest sequence correctly. It has remained a popular choice for both children and adults as a brain-teasing and entertaining pastime.

# HOW TO PLAY

Start the Game: The game begins with a simple sequence of one color lighting up and emitting a sound.

Watch and Listen: Pay close attention to the sequence. The button that lights up corresponds to a color, and it will also emit a sound. Remember both the color and the sound associated with the first step in the sequence.

Repeat the Sequence: After the game unit plays the initial sequence, it's your turn. Press the button that corresponds to the first color and sound in the sequence. If you get it right, the game will add another step to the sequence.

Continue Playing: The game keeps adding steps to the sequence, and you need to repeat the entire sequence in the correct order each time. You should follow the sequence of colors and sounds as it grows longer. Try to memorize the pattern as best as you can.

Mistakes and Game Over: If you press the wrong button or fail to repeat the sequence correctly, the game will indicate that you've made a mistake, and it will end. Your score, which is usually based on the number of steps you completed correctly, will be displayed.

Retry: If you want to play again and try to beat your previous score, you can press a designated button (often labeled "Start" or "Retry") to begin a new game.
